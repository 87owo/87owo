## Hi there, Here is my self introduction. 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on security and deep learning projects, integrating them across various industries.
- 🤔 I was born after 2000, I'm not sharing my exact age or birthday. Just know that I'm a student.
- ⚡ I currently have over a million lines of code development experience, primarily using Python and C.
- 💬 You can contact me on Discord. There should be a group invite link next to my Github homepage.
- ♥️ For public projects, the agreement is relatively loose, but it is still recommended to apply for authorization.
