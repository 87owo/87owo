## 👋 Hi there, Here is my self introduction.

- 🔭 I'm working on security and deep learning projects, integrating them across various industries.
- ⚡ I currently have over a million lines of code development experience, primarily using Python and C.
- 💬 You can contact me on Discord. There should be a group invite link next to my Github homepage.
- 🔏 For public projects, the agreement is relatively loose, but it is still recommended to comply.
- ❤️‍🩹 The developers are poor, if you are willing to sponsor some resources, you are always welcome.
